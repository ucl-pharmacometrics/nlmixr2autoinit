\value{
A \code{data.frame} of unique parameter combinations with source labels and values.
}
\description{
Constructs a grid of all combinations of ka, cl, and vd parameters from
different sources (e.g., simpcal, graph, NCA methods), and removes combinations
that are redundant based on relative tolerance. Only oral routes consider ka value
for deduplication. Any parameter value set that includes NA is removed up front.
