\usage{
calculate_cl(
  dat,
  half_life = NULL,
  dose_type = NULL,
  pooled_ctrl = pooled_control(),
  ssctrl = ss_control()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A data frame containing pharmacokinetic data.
Required columns typically include ID, TIME, DV, tad, recent_ii,
dose, routeobs, and durationobs.}

\item{half_life}{Optional numeric value for the drug's half-life.
If not provided, it will be estimated using get_hf() from pooled
observations.}

\item{dose_type}{Specifies the dosing context of the pharmacokinetic
observations. Required when half_life is not provided. Classified as
first_dose, repeated_doses, or combined_doses based on whether observed
concentrations occur following the first administration, during repeated
dosing, or across both contexts.}

\item{pooled_ctrl}{A list of control settings generated by
pooled_control() to define pooling rules for half-life estimation.}

\item{ssctrl}{A list of control parameters generated by
ss_control() to guide the detection of steady-state observations.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item dat: the processed dataset with steady-state identification
\item cl_df: individual clearance estimates
\item trimmed_mean_cl: the population clearance calculated as a trimmed
geometric mean with a 5 percent trimming level to reduce the impact
of outliers
}
}
\description{
Calculates drug clearance (CL) from steady-state pharmacokinetic data using
an adaptive single-point approach.
}
\details{
Estimates individual and population clearance from steady-state
pharmacokinetic data. If half-life is not provided, it is estimated
from pooled data using get_hf() and pooling rules defined in
pooled_control().

The procedure:
\itemize{
\item Identifies steady-state observations using is_ss() and
ss_control() criteria.
\item Selects peak and trough concentrations within each dose
interval to represent steady-state behavior.
\item Classifies concentration points as Css_max, Css_min, or
Css_avg based on timing within the interval and decay pattern.
\item Computes individual clearance as Dose / (Css_avg Ã— tau).
\item Aggregates individual clearance values using a trimmed
geometric mean to obtain a population estimate.
}

Supports bolus, infusion, and oral administration routes.
