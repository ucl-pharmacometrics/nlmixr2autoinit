\title{Perform extended single-point pharmacokinetic calculations}
\usage{
single_point_extra(single_point_base.lst)
}
\arguments{
\item{single_point_base.lst}{A list object returned by \code{single_point_base}, containing preprocessed data and initial calculations for \(CL\) and \(V_d\).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{singlepoint.results}: A data frame with estimated \(k_a\), \(CL\), \(V_d\), and processing time.
\item \code{dat}: The input dataset used in the calculations.
\item \code{single_point_ka_df}: Data used for \(k_a\) calculations (if applicable).
\item \code{single_point_cl_df}: Data used for \(CL\) calculations.
\item \code{single_point_vd_df}: Data used for \(V_d\) calculations.
\item \code{single_point_vd_cmax_df}: \(C_{\text{max}}\) data used for \(V_d\) estimation.
}
}
\description{
Extends the single-point pharmacokinetic calculations by incorporating additional logic to derive clearance (\(CL\)), volume of distribution (\(V_d\)), and absorption rate constant (\(k_a\)) based on the availability of data. The function evaluates data completeness and uses appropriate methods to estimate parameters when certain data types are unavailable.
}
\details{
The function uses a series of conditional logic to determine which pharmacokinetic parameters can be reliably calculated based on the available data:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Complete Data for \(CL\) and \(V_d\):}
\itemize{
\item If both steady-state data and single-dose data are available, \(CL\) and \(V_d\) are calculated directly.
}
\item \strong{Incomplete Data for \(V_d\):}
\itemize{
\item If \(V_d\) cannot be calculated but \(CL\) and \(t_{1/2}\) are available, \(V_d\) is derived using:
[
V_d = \frac{CL \cdot t_{1/2}}{\ln(2)}
]
}
\item \strong{Incomplete Data for \(CL\):}
\itemize{
\item If \(CL\) cannot be calculated but \(V_d\) and \(t_{1/2}\) are available, \(CL\) is derived using:
[
CL = \frac{V_d \cdot \ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}
]
}
\item \strong{Insufficient Data for Both \(CL\) and \(V_d\):}
\itemize{
\item If neither \(CL\) nor \(V_d\) can be directly calculated, \(V_d\) is estimated from \(C_{\text{max}}\) and dose:
[
V_d = \frac{\text{Dose}}{C_{\text{max}}}
]
\(CL\) is then derived from \(V_d\) and \(t_{1/2}\).
}
\item \strong{Oral Absorption Rate (\(k_a\)):}
\itemize{
\item For oral dosing, \(k_a\) is estimated using data within the dose interval, considering \(t_{\text{max}}\) and the condition:
[
\text{tad} < 0.2 \cdot \frac{CL}{V_d}
]
\(k_a\) is then computed using an iterative solution.
